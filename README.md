# C++ Design Patterns

Welcome to the **C++ Design Patterns** repository!  
This project serves as a practical guide and reference implementation for some of the most important **Structural Design Patterns** in software engineering, using modern C++.

## ðŸ“Œ Covered Design Patterns

This repository covers the following **Structural Design Patterns**:

### 1. Adapter
> Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.

- Useful for integrating legacy code with modern systems.
- Example included: Adapting a legacy audio player to a modern interface.

### 2. Bridge
> Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

- Promotes flexibility and scalability.
- Example: A shape abstraction with different rendering strategies.

### 3. Composite
> Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

- Enables clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- Example: Building a file system with files and folders.

### 4. Decorator
> Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.

- Provides a flexible alternative to subclassing.
- Example: Adding features to a text editor component (like scrollbars, borders, etc).

### 5. Facade
> Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.

- Simplifies interaction with complex subsystems.
- Example: Simplified interface to a multimedia library.

### 6. Flyweight
> Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.

- Ideal for minimizing memory usage.
- Example: Efficient rendering of characters in a document editor.

### 7. Proxy
> Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

- Useful for lazy loading, access control, logging, etc.
- Example: Virtual proxy for expensive-to-load image data.

## ðŸ§  Why Design Patterns?


Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems in software design. They help in:

- Writing reusable and maintainable code
- Communicating ideas effectively across teams
- Building robust and scalable systems
